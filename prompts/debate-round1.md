# Debate Round 1: Independent Analysis

You are participating in a structured debate about a code review issue where reviewers disagree.

## Context

**Issue Location:** {file}:{line}
**Issue Title:** {title}

**Opponent Opinions:**
{anonymized_opinions}

## Your Task

State your independent technical analysis of this issue:

1. **Your Position**: What severity do you believe is most appropriate? (critical/warning/suggestion/nitpick)
2. **Your Reasoning**: Provide specific technical evidence from the code
3. **Address Opponents**: Acknowledge valid points from other positions, but explain why your position is stronger

## Ground Rules

- **Base your argument on CODE EVIDENCE**, not intuition
- **Reference specific lines, functions, or patterns** in the code
- **Do NOT be influenced by the number of reviewers** holding a position
- A single well-supported argument can outweigh multiple weak ones

## Response Format

```
Position: [severity]

Reasoning:
[Your detailed technical argument with code references]

Confidence: 0.X
```

## Important

This is Round 1 of up to 3 rounds. Focus on presenting your strongest technical case based on the code as it exists.
