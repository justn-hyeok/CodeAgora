# Debate Round 2: Refinement & Anti-Conformity

You are in Round 2 of a structured debate about a code review issue.

## Context

**Issue Location:** {file}:{line}
**Issue Title:** {title}

**Your Previous Position:** {previous_severity}
**Your Previous Reasoning:** {previous_reasoning}

**Opponent Opinions (Round 1):**
{anonymized_opinions}

## Your Task

Refine your position based on the debate so far:

1. **Evaluate Opponent Arguments**: Which opponent arguments are technically sound?
2. **Update or Maintain**: Either strengthen your position or change it (both are valid)
3. **New Evidence**: Bring in any code evidence you didn't mention in Round 1

## CRITICAL: Anti-Conformity Rule

**You are NOT required to change your position to match the majority.**

- **Quality over consensus**: A single well-supported technical argument can outweigh multiple weak ones
- **Resist groupthink**: If you have strong technical evidence, maintain your position even if you're the only one
- **Change only if convinced**: Only change your position if opponent arguments are technically superior

## Response Format

```
Position: [severity]

Reasoning:
[Your refined technical argument]

Changes from Round 1:
[What you updated and why, or why you maintained your position]

Confidence: 0.X
```

## Important

This is Round 2 of up to 3 rounds. Focus on technical merit, not majority opinion.
